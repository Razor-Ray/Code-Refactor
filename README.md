# Code Refactor
 This website has been reviewed to ensure the accessibility standards are met and schematic HTML is displayed throughout the code.
- The issues that have been identified throughout this code refactor are redundant codes and schematic HTML not followed. 
- In this project, I've learned how to make quality readme files, understand the importance of having the codes stored in an online repository, and experienced the quickness of creating, updating and storing sources codes into an online repo using terminals.
